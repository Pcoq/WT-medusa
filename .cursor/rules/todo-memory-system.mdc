Rule Name: todo-memory-system
Description: Always use TODO.md as a memory system for tracking development progress, tasks, and project context.

## TODO.md Memory System Protocol

You MUST always follow this protocol when working on this project:

### 1. Start Every Session
- **ALWAYS** read `TODO.md` first to understand current project state
- Check what tasks are completed, in progress, or pending

### 2. Update Progress Continuously
- **BEFORE** starting any new task: Add it to the "In Progress" section
- **DURING** work: Update status and add relevant notes
- **AFTER** completion: Move tasks to "Completed" section with checkmarks

### 3. Maintain Context
- Add important discoveries, decisions, or patterns to the "Notes" section
- Track key file locations and their purposes

### 4. Task Organization
Use this format:
```
### âœ… Completed
- [x] Task description with context

### ðŸ”„ In Progress  
- [ ] Current task being worked on

### ðŸ“‹ Pending Tasks
- [ ] Future tasks or features to implement
```

### 5. Memory Persistence
- Update timestamp at bottom: `*Last updated: [current session/date]*`
- Cross-reference with other project files when relevant

This rule ensures continuity across sessions and maintains comprehensive project memory.
