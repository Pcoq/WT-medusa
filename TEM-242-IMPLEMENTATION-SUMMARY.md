# TEM-242: Phase 3 - Drag-and-Drop Scheduling Implementation Summary

**Status:** ✅ COMPLETED  
**Date:** October 25, 2025  
**Parent Ticket:** TEM-239 (Service Order Calendar View Feature)

## Overview

Successfully implemented comprehensive drag-and-drop scheduling functionality for the service order calendar view, enabling users to reschedule service orders by dragging events to new dates and resizing them to change duration. The implementation includes optimistic UI updates, validation rules, and seamless integration with the existing backend API.

## Sub-Tickets Completed

### ✅ TEM-254: Implement drag-and-drop for calendar events
**Status:** Done  
**Implementation:**
- Added native HTML5 drag-and-drop API to `CalendarEvent` component
- Implemented drag start/end handlers with visual feedback
- Added drop zone handlers to `CalendarView` component
- Visual indicators: opacity change during drag, cursor changes, drop zone highlighting
- Stores event data in `dataTransfer` for use on drop

**Key Changes:**
- `src/admin/routes/service-orders/components/calendar-event.tsx`
  - Added `draggable` attribute
  - `handleDragStart()` - stores service order ID and date data
  - `handleDragEnd()` - resets visual state
  - Visual feedback with opacity and scale transitions
  
- `src/admin/routes/service-orders/components/calendar-view.tsx`
  - `handleDragOver()` - allows drop and shows visual feedback
  - `handleDragLeave()` - removes visual feedback

- Supports both start and end date updates

---

### ✅ TEM-257: Add event resize functionality
**Status:** Done  
**Implementation:**
- Resize handles on event bottom edge (visible on hover)
- Mouse-based resize with visual feedback
- Minimum duration enforcement (1 hour)
- Integrated with optimistic update hooks
- Prevents drag when resizing

**Key Changes:**
- `src/admin/routes/service-orders/components/calendar-event.tsx`

    - Start before end date (error)
    - Minimum duration 30 minutes (error)
    - Cannot reschedule completed orders (error)
    - Past date scheduling (warning with time details)
    - Long duration warnings (7+ days, 30+ days)
  - `validateResize()` - resize-specific validation
  - `formatValidationMessages()` - user-friendly formatting
  - `findConflictingEvents()` - conflict detection helper

- `src/admin/routes/service-orders/components/calendar-view.tsx`

  - Toast notifications for errors and warnings

- `src/admin/routes/service-orders/components/calendar-event.tsx`
  - Integrated validation in resize handler
  - Prevents invalid resize operations
  - Shows warnings on mouse up

**Validation Rules:**
1. **Errors (blocking):**
   - Start date must be before end date
   - Minimum duration: 30 minutes
   - Cannot reschedule completed orders

2. **Warnings (non-blocking):**
   - Scheduling in the past (with time difference)
   - Duration > 7 days
   - Duration > 30 days

## Technical Architecture

### Data Flow

1. **Drag Start:**
   ```
   User drags event → handleDragStart() → Store data in dataTransfer
   → Visual feedback (opacity, cursor)
   ```

2. **Drop:**
   ```
   User drops event → handleDrop() → Extract data from dataTransfer
   → calculateNewDates() → Preserve duration
   → validateScheduleChange() → Check rules
   → If valid: updateSchedule.mutate() → Optimistic update
   → API call → Success/Error handling
   ```

3. **Resize:**
   ```
   User drags resize handle → handleResizeStart() → Attach mouse listeners
   → Mouse move → Calculate new end date → validateResize()
   → If valid: Update preview
   → Mouse up → resizeEvent.mutate() → Optimistic update
   → API call → Success/Error handling
   ```

### State Management

- **Local State (React):**
  - `isDragging` - visual feedback during drag
  - `isResizing` - visual feedback during resize
  - `dragOverDate` - drop zone highlighting

- **Server State (React Query):**
  - Calendar events cached with key `['service-orders-calendar']`
  - Optimistic updates modify cache immediately
  - Rollback on error
  - Invalidation on success

### Validation Flow

```
Operation initiated
  ↓
Calculate new dates
  ↓
Validate dates
  ↓
Errors? → Yes → Show toast.error → Block operation
  ↓ No
Warnings? → Yes → Show toast.warning → Allow operation
  ↓ No
Proceed with mutation
```

## User Experience Improvements

1. **Instant Feedback:**
   - Events move immediately (optimistic updates)
   - No waiting for API response
   - Smooth transitions and animations

2. **Visual Indicators:**
   - Opacity change during drag
   - Drop zone highlighting
   - Cursor changes (move, resize)
   - Resize handle on hover

3. **Error Prevention:**
   - Validation blocks invalid operations
   - Clear error messages
   - Warnings for edge cases
   - Minimum duration enforcement

4. **Intuitive Interactions:**
   - Drag to reschedule
   - Resize to change duration
   - Click to view details
   - Hover for status information

## API Integration

### Endpoint Used
```
POST /admin/service-orders/:id/schedule
```

### Request Body
```json
{
  "scheduled_start_date": "2025-10-26T10:00:00.000Z",
  "scheduled_end_date": "2025-10-26T12:00:00.000Z"
}
```

### Response
```json
{
  "service_order": { /* updated service order */ },
  "message": "Service order schedule updated successfully"

## Testing Considerations

### Manual Testing Checklist

- [ ] Drag event to new date in month view
- [ ] Drag event to new date in day view
- [ ] Drag multi-day event
- [ ] Resize event to longer duration
- [ ] Resize event to shorter duration
- [ ] Try to resize below minimum duration (should block)
- [ ] Try to drag to past date (should warn)
- [ ] Try to reschedule completed order (should block)
- [ ] Check optimistic update (should move immediately)
- [ ] Simulate API error (should rollback)
- [ ] Check toast notifications (success, error, warning)
- [ ] Verify calendar refetches after update

### Edge Cases Handled

1. **Multi-day events:** Duration and time preserved
2. **Past dates:** Warning shown but allowed
3. **Completed orders:** Blocked from rescheduling
4. **Very short durations:** Blocked (< 30 min)
5. **Very long durations:** Warning shown (> 7 days, > 30 days)
6. **API failures:** Automatic rollback with error message
7. **Concurrent operations:** Query cancellation prevents race conditions

## Performance Considerations

1. **Optimistic Updates:**
   - Reduces perceived latency
   - Immediate visual feedback
   - Better user experience

2. **Query Caching:**
   - 30-second stale time
   - 5-minute garbage collection
   - Reduces unnecessary API calls

3. **Event Listeners:**
   - Properly cleaned up on unmount
   - No memory leaks
   - Efficient mouse tracking

## Future Enhancements

1. **Conflict Detection:**
   - Check technician availability
   - Highlight conflicting events
   - Suggest alternative times

2. **Batch Operations:**
   - Select multiple events
   - Drag multiple events together
   - Bulk reschedule

3. **Undo/Redo:**
   - History stack
   - Keyboard shortcuts
   - Visual undo indicator

4. **Advanced Validation:**
   - Business hours constraints
   - Resource availability
   - Customer preferences

5. **Touch Support:**
   - Mobile-friendly drag-and-drop
   - Touch gestures
   - Responsive design
